# Searching

Searching is the process of finding the location of a given element in a set of elements. 
The search is successful if the given element is found, except in caste that the element does exist in the collection.

They are designed to find and retrieve element in any data structure that it is stored in.

We can divide search algorithms in to two main categories :

 - Sequential search - where we traverse the data structure one element at a time respecting the original sequnce
 - Interval search - where we traverse the data structure one element at a time but in intervals or patterns (other then sequential pattern)


## The project contains these algorithams :

- Linear/Sequential search
- Jump search
- Binary search
- Ternary search
- Exponential search
- Interpolation search
- Fibonnaci search
- Sublist search
