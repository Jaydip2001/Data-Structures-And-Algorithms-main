# Linear Search

## Definition

Linear search is the technique of searching a given item in the list by comparing each and every element in the list sequentially. 

Suppose DATA is an array with N elements, let ITEM be the element to be searched in DATA. Traverse
the array DATA sequentially and search for the ITEM by comparing each element of it with ITEM, i.e. first
compare DATA[1] with ITEM and then DATA[2] with ITEM and so on until ITEM is found.


## Time complexity 

Worst case scenario is O(n) in case that the element is last in the array.

Average case scenario is  θ(n) 

and best case is Ω(1) if the element is first in the collection

## Space complexity 

O(1)
