# Sorting


Sorting is a technique to arrange a set of items in some order defined by the comparsion operator.

One practical reason is that performing search of something is much easier in a sorted list than in unsorted one.

Other practical reason is that we can sort more effectivly set of objects by their property of intrest (ex. price, hight ...)
and provide the data sequnce of object as such to clients of an application.
