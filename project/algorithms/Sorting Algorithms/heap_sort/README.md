# Heap Sort

## Definition

Heap sort algorithm combines merge and insertion sort. Heap sort inherits the worst case scenario of merge sort O(n*log(n))
The algorithm sorts by inserting elements in their appropriate position, just like insertion sort does.

## Time colpexity

Insertion sort worst case scenario is O(n*log(n)), as is average θ(n*log(n)) and best case Ω(n).

### Space complexity

O(n)
