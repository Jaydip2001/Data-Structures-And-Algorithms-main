# Merge Sort


### Defintion

Merging is the process of combining two ordered lists of elements and merged into a single ordered list. 
Merge sort can be formatted in two ways : recursive and non-recursive way .
The recursive version of merge sort uses the principle of divide and conquer. 
Here the given list to be sorted is divided into two sublists of approximately equal in size. These sublists are sorted
recursively and all the sorted sublists are merged into a single list which is the required sorted list

### Time complexity

Insertion sort worst case scenario is O(n*log(n)), as is average θ(n*log(n)) and best case Ω(n*log(n)).

### Space complexity

O(n)
