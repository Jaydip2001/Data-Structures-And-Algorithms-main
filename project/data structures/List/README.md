# Linked Lists

### Defintion

Liked lists are linked collection of data elements called nodes and the adjacency is provided with links or pointers to the next element in the sequnce.

While arrays are static data structures linked lists are dynamic because they allocate memory on the runtime which can be extended if neccessary.
Still linked lists can be static if we store data in arrays in which case we use two arrays, one for storing the data and another to store coresponding pointer to the next node.

### Clasification of linked lists

- Singly linked lists
