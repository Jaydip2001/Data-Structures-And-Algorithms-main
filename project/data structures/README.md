# Data Structures

### Defintion & Intro

A data structures are logical or mathematical models of representing data and provide the easiest way to store and perform different operations on the data of that structure.
Goal of data structures is to reduce time required to performe operation on the data set and how much space data requires.

They are represented as ADT (Abstract data types).
ADTs are conceptual specification of objects and operations that they can perform on data (interface of the sorts).
ADTs themslef dont have implementation but they hold the requirments which data structures have to implement.
Solo purpose is to offer abstractian and encapsulation which allow freedom and independence of language, platform, framework and such.

Abstraction - Hiding internal details/characteristics and focusing on representing set of essential characteristics
Encapsulation - Combining data and functions that operate the data into single unit 

ADTs usualy :
 - allow various attributes
 - allowo perations on set of data
 - are finite

Data structures are clasified into two groupes :
 - Linear data structures (data perserves its order/sequnce)
 - Non-Linear data structures (there is no order/sequnce)

### Listing of data structures

## Linear:

 - Arrays 
 - Lists
 - Queues
 - Stacks
 
 ## Non-Linear:
- Trees
- Graphs
- Matrices
- Heaps

## Both:
- Hash maps
