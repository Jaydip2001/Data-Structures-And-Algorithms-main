# Arrays

### Defintion

Arrays are structures that contain finite number of homogenous elements held in a contiguous memory locations which allows easy and quick access.

Arrays differ in there number of dimensions which creates clasification of single-dimensional arrays and multi-dimensional arrays.

Mathematicaly 1D arrays can be represented as row vectors of size n while nD arrays can be represented as matrices of size n*m*k*...

Arrays are static  data strucutures because they are linear data structures which memory is allocated in advance to maintina adjeacency of data.

### Storage requirment

- staticly allocated contignues n size block of memory

### Operational requirements

Arrays should allow following operations on data :

- Traversing - visiting elements of array in sequnce/order one by one
- Inserting - first,last or specific position
- Deleting - first,last or specific position
- Searching - retrive location of particular element in the structure
- Sorting - arranging elements into specific order depending on comparison operator of data type
